# FilipiKnow  
&gt; *"Alam mo ba?"* — bite-sized Filipino facts, figures & folklore, served in CLI.

## What it is  
A zero-dependency Bash script that prints a random Filipino fact every time you run it.  
Think of it as a fortune-mod, but everything is proudly Pinoy: baybayin, adobo ratios, jeepney routes, historical “did-you-knows”, and the exact number of islands we pretended to have in grade school.
